#### Research study:
5K+ CT Images on Fractured Limbs: A Dataset for Medical Imaging Research


#### Abstract
Imaging techniques widely use Computed Tomography (CT) scans for various purposes, such as screening, diagnosis, and decision-making. Of all, it holds true for bone injuries. To build fully automated Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) and Diagnosis (CADx) tools and techniques, it requires fairly large amount of data (with gold standard). Therefore, in this paper, since state-of-the-art works relied on small dataset, we introduced a CT image dataset on limbs that is designed to understand bone injuries. Our dataset is a collection of 24 patient-specific CT cases having fractures at upper and lower limbs. From upper limbs, 8 cases were collected from bones in/around the shoulder (left and right). Similarly, from lower limbs, 16 cases were collected from knees (left and right). Altogether, 5684 CT images (upper limbs: 2057 and lower limbs: 3627) were collected. Each patient-specific CT case is composed of maximum 257 scans/slices in average. Of all, clinically approved annotations were made on every 10th slices, resulting in 1787 images. Importantly, no fractured limbs were missed in our annotation. Besides, to avoid privacy and confidential issues, patient-related information were deleted. The proposed dataset could be a promising resource for the medical imaging research community, where imaging techniques are employed for various purposes. 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time 5K+ CT images on fractured limbs are provided for research and educational purposes.
